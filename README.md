# FAIREWARE-license

## Disclaimer
I am NOT a lawyer!  
And I think at some point I should pay one to look over this. But for now lets call everything Work in Progress.

## What?
Offering a template for a fair software licensing model. Aimed for developers who want to combine open source software and its benefits with the opportunity to earn some dimes.

## Why?
The Fairware License is designed to 

  - promote open collaboration and knowledge sharing 
  - while   ensuring fair compensation for contributions when the software is used commercially.

This license enables individuals to use and contribute to the Software for 

  - personal, academic, and research purposes at no cost

with the aim of

  - fostering an environment of transparency and support and
  - harnessing the synergies of open-source development through shared insights and peer reviews

while   also recognizing the value of the work involved.

I aim to create a community where 

  - everyone can benefit from the collective effort, 
  - while   also ensuring that commercial use is accompanied by appropriate compensation for both the original developers and contributors. 

This approach tries to balance the principles of openness with the need for sustainable support for ongoing development. Without the need to form a company around the software.

## Ok and Why? (For Whom?)
Imagine you (think) you have a great idea or solution for something and would like to start a project on Github/GitLab. Now you fantasize that this is actually a good idea with which in the future you could earn some dimes. But you also want to be open source with help from the community, maybe someone who also think that this is a good idea. But you cannot in good conscience sell their work as yours. Also you have a real Job which you don't want to terminate just yet.

** With no intend of selling his modified copy.  
   If at some later point an intentionto sell arises the Public Owner has to buy a License Agreement. 
   If a merge into the OWNERs latest Software Version is possible, a Fair Share Agreement could be signed with the OWNER
   making the Public Owner (and all his Contributors) Contributors of the Original Software.

## Contracts?
In an ideal world everyone is fair, does not wish harm to anyone, looks out for the weak and tries to remove problems and conflicts...

Buuut in case you don't live in such a world, you might want to have a look at the contract templates. And yes, that is a big downside of the Fairware model: In contrast to open source software with a permissive License model like MIT you have to make a contract with every contributor. This includes making sure that no private information about the contributors is shared with anyone else.  
On the plus side, you can earn money as a single software developer/freelancer/part-time self-employed and simultaneously having an open source project with (hopefully) some useful contributions.

## Changes
